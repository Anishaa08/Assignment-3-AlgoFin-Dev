# Assignment-3-AlgoFin-Dev

Objective
The objective of this assignment was to analyze and implement a pair trading strategy using two stocks from the Nifty 50 index. The main steps involved were:

Correlation Analysis: Collect historical daily price data for all stocks in the Nifty 50 index over the past year and calculate the correlation coefficients between each pair of stocks using daily price returns. Create a correlation matrix to identify a pair of stocks with a historically stable relationship suitable for pair trading.

Stock Selection: Choose two stocks based on their correlation values and justify the selection by considering sector similarity, business fundamentals, or industry dynamics.

Pair Trading Strategy Implementation and Analysis: Calculate the spread between the prices of the selected stocks using a suitable statistical method, such as the price ratio or z-score. Develop rules for entering and exiting trades, position sizing, and risk management. Evaluate the performance of the strategy and optimize it using various measures.

Process
Data Collection and Correlation Analysis

Collected historical daily price data for all stocks in the Nifty 50 index over the past year.
Calculated the correlation coefficients between each pair of stocks using daily price returns.
Created a correlation matrix to visualize the correlation values between all possible pairs of stocks.
Analyzed the correlation matrix to identify a pair of stocks (Stock A and Stock B) with a high correlation coefficient and a historically stable relationship.
Stock Selection

After conducting the correlation analysis, identified Stock A and Stock B as the suitable pair for the pair trading strategy.
Justified the selection by considering their high correlation coefficient and additional factors like being from the same sector, having similar business fundamentals, and operating in related industries.
Pair Trading Strategy Implementation

Calculated the spread between the prices of Stock A and Stock B using the price ratio method.
Developed rules for entering and exiting trades based on the spread and the z-score of the price ratio.
Set up position sizing and risk management rules to control the size of each trade and manage potential losses.
Performance Evaluation and Optimization

Evaluated the performance of the pair trading strategy using historical data.
Considered factors like returns, risk-adjusted returns, drawdowns, and other performance metrics to assess the strategy's effectiveness.
Optimized the strategy by fine-tuning the entry and exit thresholds, stop-loss levels, and profit targets.
Accounted for transaction costs, slippage, and other practical considerations in the optimization process.
Conclusion
The pair trading strategy assignment involved a systematic approach to identify, implement, and evaluate a pair of stocks for pair trading from the Nifty 50 index. By conducting correlation analysis and considering additional factors, we selected a suitable pair of stocks (Stock A and Stock B) with a stable relationship. We then implemented the strategy by calculating the spread between the prices of the two stocks and developed rules for entering and exiting trades, position sizing, and risk management. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the strategy and optimized it using various measures.

Please note that this assignment provides a basic outline of the pair trading strategy, and real-world implementation may require further research, backtesting, and adjustments. Always perform extensive testing and consult with a financial professional before implementing any trading strategy with real money.
